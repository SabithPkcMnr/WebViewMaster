# WebViewMaster
This is a Android WebView sample project. Including all the significant role characters of WebView into the app. See the screenshot for further information. A project by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/SabithPkcMnr?sub_confirmation=1">Sabith Pkc Mnr!</a>

# How this work?
I have included some useful methods of WebView to bring a browser environment to a simple Blank Activity of Android Studio. This include:
<h3>WebView Methods</h3>
-JavaScript support.<br>
-Back Button to previous page.<br>
-Forward Button to last page opened.<br>
-ProgressBar represending the web progress.<br>
-Page Title on ActionBar<br>
-Page Favicon on ImageView<br>
-Download Listener to check if a file ready to download<br>
<br>
<h3>Extras</h3>
-Webpage Title on ActionBar
-App Exit Dialog on first page<br>
-Back button to go back (otherthan web back button)

Hope that you like it! Here's a screenshot on how it works!
